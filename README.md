## Pydoku basic documentation

This program creates randomized sudoku puzzles using python. It creates 2 folders, _puzzles_ and _answers_. Creating puzzles and answers to them as specified below.

The **main.py** program takes 2 optional arguments
1. number of pages pages to be created, there are 2 puzzles on each page. The default is **1**
2. amount of numbers each puzzle starts with filled in. The default is **40**

For example to create 100 pages of puzzles, each with 35 filled in you would run ```python main.py 100 35``` or ```py -3 main.py 100 35``` if that doesnt work in your system.
